Hello, to give something back to the infosec community  I decided to start a new series on web application pen-testing. And this would be the first post.
I was really struggling to find an effective way to learn about web application vulnerabilities, once you start lookig for some learning ressources and methodologies you'll be lost in between youtube videos, tweets and even medium article. I tried to put all together and create my own methodology. Here is my steps :

## Step 1 : Learn the basics in a fun way
Picking up the initial idea about a web attck is an easy process if you have a guide walking you through it. when it comes to web vulnerabilities the best way to understand the basics is by watching a youtube video, [**PwnFunction**](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLI_rLWXMqpSl_TqX9bbisW-d7tDqcVvOJ) is my best channel as he explains using illustrations and some simple examples wich makes it biginner friendly. [**Intigriti**](https://www.youtube.com/c/intigriti/featured) also has some good explanation videos.</br>
If you understand arabic the best paylist for you would be : [**Web Application Penetration Testing Course**](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLv7cogHXoVhXvHPzIl1dWtBiYUAL8baHj) by Ebrahem Hegazy

## Step 2 : Dig a little bit deeper by reading a book
