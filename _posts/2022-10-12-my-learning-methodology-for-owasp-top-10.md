Hello, to give something back to the infosec community  I decided to start a new series on web application pen-testing. And this would be the first post.
I was really struggling to find an effective way to learn about web application vulnerabilities, once you start lookig for some learning ressources and methodologies you'll be lost in between youtube videos, tweets and even medium article. I tried to put all together and create my own methodology. Here is my steps :

## Step 1 : Learn the basics in a fun way
Picking up the initial idea about a web attck is an easy process if you have a guide walking you through it. when it comes to web vulnerabilities the best way to understand the basics is by watching a youtube video, [**PwnFunction**](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLI_rLWXMqpSl_TqX9bbisW-d7tDqcVvOJ) is my best channel as he explains using illustrations and some simple examples wich makes it biginner friendly. [**Intigriti**](https://www.youtube.com/c/intigriti/featured) also has some good explanation videos.

## Step 2 : Dig a little bit deeper by reading a book chapter
After having a general idea about a web vulerability, don't jump directally to solve labs or ctfs, try to understand it's different scenarios, baypass & prevension techniques. There is a lot of books out there, the popular one is : **The Web Application Hacker's Handbook** but I don't use this book, it's about 912 pages and it's kindaa outdated. Instead, I do recommend the [**Bug Bounty Bootcamp**](https://nostarch.com/bug-bounty-bootcamp) : it's a comprehensive guide for any web application hacker with detailed exploration of the many vulnerabilities present in modern websites and the hands-on techniques you can use to most successfully exploit them.
The book contains a wide range of techniques :
- [x] Identify and successfully exploit a wide array of common web vulnerabilities
- [x] Set up a hacking environment, configure Burp Suite, and use its modules to intercept traffic and hunt for bugs
- [x] Chain together multiple bugs for maximum impact and higher payouts
- [x] Bypass protection mechanisms like input sanitization and blocklists to make your attacks succeed
- [x] Automate tedious bug-hunting tasks with fuzzing and bash scripting

## Step 3 : Get your hands dirty with labs
Now it's time to practice what you learned. When it comes to web security the best plateform for you would be the [**Web Security Academy**](https://portswigger.net/web-security), it contains high-quality learning materials, interactive vulnerability labs, and video tutorials. You can learn at your own pace, wherever and whenever suits you. Best of all, **everything is free!**

The Web Security Academy is a living resource that we'll continue updating with new material and labs (**Now it has more than 220 lab**), covering the latest developments in web security research. We very much hope that the Web Security Academy will fulfill the purpose that The Web Application Hacker's Handbook has done in the past, and help the next generation of web hackers acquire the skills and knowledge that they need.

## Step 3 : Notetaking keeps you alert
No one can deny that notetaking is the only way that will help you memorise what you've learned, I personally use [**Notion**](https://notion.so) for several reasons :
